                    <li>Bodybuilding is a discipline focused on developing muscle size, symmetry, and aesthetics through resistance training. It involves performing exercises that target specific muscle groups, often utilizing moderate to high rep ranges. The typical rep range in bodybuilding falls between 8 and 12 reps per set, allowing for a balance between muscle endurance and hypertrophy. Rest times are relatively shorter, ranging from 30 to 90 seconds between sets. This shorter rest period helps to maintain an elevated heart rate and promote muscle hypertrophy by inducing metabolic stress.</li><br>
                    <li>Powerlifting is a strength-based sport that centers around three main lifts: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. The primary goal of powerlifting is to lift the maximum amount of weight possible in these specific lifts. Powerlifters prioritize building strength and muscle mass. Rep ranges in powerlifting are generally lower, with a focus on heavy weights and maximal effort. Lifters typically perform 1 to 5 reps per set to optimize strength gains. Longer rest times, usually ranging from 2 to 5 minutes, are taken between sets to allow for full recovery and maximal effort on each lift.</li><br>
                    <li>Powerbuilding combines elements of bodybuilding and powerlifting, aiming to build both strength and size simultaneously. This training approach incorporates a variety of rep ranges, providing a balanced stimulus for both strength and hypertrophy. Lower rep ranges (1 to 5 reps per set) are used for strength development, while higher rep ranges (8 to 12 reps per set) are employed for hypertrophy. Rest times can vary depending on the specific training phase, but typically range from 1 to 3 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Calisthenics, also known as bodyweight training, is a form of exercise that utilizes the individual's body weight for resistance. It focuses on developing strength, flexibility, and body control. Calisthenics exercises include movements like push-ups, pull-ups, squats, and planks. Rep ranges in calisthenics can vary depending on the exercise and the individual's fitness level. Beginners may start with higher rep ranges (8 to 15 reps), while advanced practitioners can perform more challenging movements with lower rep ranges (3 to 8 reps). Rest times in calisthenics are typically shorter, ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on the intensity and complexity of the exercises.</li><br>
