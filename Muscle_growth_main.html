                    The short and really simple version:    
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As a new weight lifter, start your workouts with a proper warm-up and focus on mastering the proper form and technique of compound exercises. Begin with a moderate rep range of 8-12 repetitions per set, challenging yourself until the last 5 reps to stimulate muscle growth. Progress gradually and prioritize safety by listening to your body and seeking guidance when needed. Incorporate variety into your training, including different exercises, rep ranges, and training modalities. Choose a suitable week split such as full body, upper/lower, push/pull/legs, or a 4-day split, ensuring adequate rest and recovery between sessions
                </p>

                    The long and precise version: 
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><a name="warm_up"></a>Start with a Warm-up: Always begin your weightlifting session with a proper warm-up to increase blood flow to the muscles and prepare your body for the workout. Perform dynamic stretches, light cardio exercises, or mobility drills for about 5-10 minutes. </li><br>
                    <li><a name="proper_form"></a>Master Proper Form: Focus on learning and executing each exercise with proper form and technique. Correct form not only maximizes the effectiveness of the exercise but also minimizes the risk of injury. Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the load as you become comfortable with the movement.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="bwce"></a>Begin with Compound Exercises: Compound exercises involve multiple muscle groups and are great for building overall strength and muscle mass. Start your workouts with exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, overhead presses, and rows. These exercises engage more muscle fibers and stimulate the release of growth hormones.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="split"></a>Sample Week Splits: There are various ways to structure your weekly training sessions. Here are a few examples of common week splits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full Body: <br>Train all major muscle groups in each session, ideally 2-3 times per week.</li><br>
                            <li>Upper/Lower Split: <br>Divide your workouts into upper body and lower body sessions. Aim for 2-3 sessions per week for each group.</li><br>
                            <li>Push/Pull/Legs Split: <br>Separate your workouts into pushing exercises (e.g., chest, shoulders, triceps), pulling exercises (e.g., back, biceps), and leg exercises. This split can be done 3 times a week or on alternate days.</li><br>
                            <li>4-Day Split: <br>Split your training into four days focusing on different muscle groups or movement patterns. For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Day 1: Chest and Triceps</li>
                                    <li>Day 2: Back and Biceps</li>
                                    <li>Day 3: Rest day</li>
                                    <li>Day 4: Legs</li>
                                    <li>Day 5: Shoulders and Abs</li>
                                    <li>Day 6: Rest day</li>
                                    <li>Day 7: Rest day</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><a name="progress"></a>Progress Gradually: As a beginner, it's important to progress gradually to avoid overloading your body and risking injury. Start with lighter weights and focus on increasing the weight incrementally as you become stronger and more confident in your technique.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="breathing"></a>Maintain Proper Breathing: Proper breathing technique is crucial during weightlifting. Exhale during the exertion phase (the concentric phase) of the lift and inhale during the relaxation phase (the eccentric phase). This helps stabilize your core and provides support to your spine.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="rest"></a>Rest and Recovery: Allow sufficient rest between sets and workouts to give your muscles time to recover and adapt. Aim for at least 48 hours of rest before training the same muscle group again. Adequate sleep, hydration, and a nutritious diet also play a vital role in recovery.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="failure"></a>Training until Failure: Training until failure refers to performing repetitions until you can no longer complete another with proper form. While it can be an effective technique for muscle growth and pushing your limits, it's not necessary to do it on every set or exercise. It can increase the risk of injury and hinder recovery. Incorporate it selectively, such as in the last set or two of an exercise.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="ltb"></a>Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how your body feels during and after each workout. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise and consult a fitness professional or healthcare provider. Push yourself, but also respect your limits.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="variety"></a>Incorporate Variety: To avoid plateaus and keep your workouts interesting, incorporate a variety of exercises and training techniques. This includes different exercises, rep ranges, tempos, and training modalities such as free weights, machines, or bodyweight exercises.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="safety"></a>Prioritize Safety: Always prioritize safety during weightlifting. Use collars on barbells, maintain a stable base of support, and use proper spotting techniques when necessary. If you're unsure about an exercise or technique, seek guidance from a qualified fitness professional.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="reps"></a>Rep Range: For beginners, it's generally recommended to start with a moderate rep range of 8-12 repetitions per set. This range promotes a balance between strength and muscle hypertrophy. As you progress, you can experiment with different rep ranges, such as lower reps (4-6) for strength or higher reps (12-15) for muscular endurance.</li><br>
                    <li><a name="consistency"></a>Be Consistent: Consistency is key to seeing progress in weightlifting. Make it a habit to train regularly and progressively overload your muscles over time. Stick to a well-rounded training program that includes strength training, cardiovascular exercise, and flexibility work.</li><br>
