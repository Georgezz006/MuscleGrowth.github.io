                    <li>Lunges: This exercise targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Step forward with one foot and lower your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.</li>

                    <li>Deadlifts: This compound exercise primarily targets the hamstrings and glutes.

Lower the weight down, keeping it close to your legs, and then return to a standing position.</li>
